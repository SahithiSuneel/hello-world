# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

## CPSC 4800: Computing for Data Analytics

In this lab you will get to practice working with github including creating and forking a repo on github

### Exercise 1 - Creating a repo on github, learning more about markdown

* Create a github account [here (https://github.com/)](https://github.com/)
* Create a new public repository called “hello-world” on github, add a description of your repository.
“My first repository on GitHub.”. Initialize this repository with a README.
* In your repository’s list of files, click README.md
* Above the file’s content, click edit.
* On the Edit file tab, create the sample README [file](https://github.com/nasimtaba/README_Template/blob/master/README.pdf) that is similar to this file, the aim is to practice working with the markdown document so please esnure that your file is looking similar to the [pdf file](https://github.com/nasimtaba/README_Template/blob/master/README.pdf) **Note: you can use this [online markdown editor website](https://dillinger.io/) to practice rendering markdown files.**
* Above the new content, click Preview changes to ensure that what you have written is similar to the
above text.
* At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you
made to the file.
* Click **Commit changes**
* Clone the repo on your desired location on your laptop, to clone the repository on your local machine,
follow the below steps:

1. In your repository that you’ve made above, under code, you will see the URL of the repository. Copy the
URL, here is an example:
2. Open terminal on Mac or Git bash on windows:

Type **pwd** to print the working directory. If you type ls, you can see the list of the files in your directory.

To change the working directory, you can type cd. For instance, you can type cd folder/to/clone-into/
to change the path to the directory that you want to clone the file. I copied the repo to my C: drive per
below example.

**Good Job. You have created a new repository including a readme file and you have learned
how to write a markdown document and clone a repo.**
