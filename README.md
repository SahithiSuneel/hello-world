# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

## CPSC 4800: Computing for Data Analytics

In this lab you will get to practice working with github including creating and forking a repo on github

### Exercise 1 - Creating a repo on github, learning more about markdown

* Create a github account [here (https://github.com/)](https://github.com/)
* Create a new public repository called “hello-world” on github, add a description of your repository.
“My first repository on GitHub.”. Initialize this repository with a README.
* In your repository’s list of files, click README.md
* Above the file’s content, click edit.
* On the Edit file tab, create the sample README [file](https://github.com/nasimtaba/README_Template/blob/master/README.pdf) that is similar to this file, the aim is to practice working with the markdown document so please esnure that your file is looking similar to the [pdf file](https://github.com/nasimtaba/README_Template/blob/master/README.pdf) **Note: you can use this [online markdown editor website](https://dillinger.io/) to practice rendering markdown files.**
* Above the new content, click Preview changes to ensure that what you have written is similar to the
above text.
* At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you
made to the file.
* Click **Commit changes**
* Clone the repo on your desired location on your laptop, to clone the repository on your local machine,
follow the below steps:

1. In your repository that you’ve made above, under code, you will see the URL of the repository. Copy the
URL, here is an example:
2. Open terminal on Mac or Git bash on windows:

Type _pwd_ to print the working directory. If you type _ls_, you can see the list of the files in your directory.

To change the working directory, you can type _cd_. For instance, you can type _cd folder/to/clone-into/_
to change the path to the directory that you want to clone the file. I copied the repo to my C: drive per
below example.

**Good Job. You have created a new repository including a readme file and you have learned
how to write a markdown document and clone a repo.**

### Exercise 2 - Forking

* On GitHub, navigate to the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository
* Fork this repository
* Clone the forked repository on your laptop

### Optional

### Exercise 4 - Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line - Optional

* Create a folder called *practice_git* on the desired location on your laptop.
* Create a new repository on GitHub. You can also add a gitignore file, a readme and a licence if you
want.
* Create a file called *first.txt* inside *practice_git*.
* Add *This file is for practicing* text inside the *first.txt*.
* Initialize an empty git repository.
* Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
* Commit the files that you’ve staged in your local repository.
* Copy the https url of your newly created repo
* In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be
pushed.
* Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
* Check your github to ensure your repo exists there along with your file.
* Add *nasimtaba* as one of the collaborators to your repo so I can check your work.

### Exercise 5 - Pull Request - Optional

When you file a pull request, all you’re doing is requesting that another developer (e.g., the project maintainer)
pulls a branch from your repository into their repository.

**For this exercise, you need to find a partner in a class**

Each person should:
* Create a new repo.
* Add a readme file to your repo.
* Write the name of your favorite authors in the readme file.

Each partner should also:
* Fork a repository of his/her partner.
* Make some changes to the Readme file of the forked repository on your account.For instance, add a
new author to the existing list of the authors.
* Commit your changes.
* Click on new pull request.Create a new pull request.
* Add comments such as “Hey I’ve updated the document.Please review and accept my change.”
* The person who owns the original repo should click on the pull requests tab and merge the pull request.
